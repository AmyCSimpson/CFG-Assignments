## Git Ignore - 

### The .gitignore file plays a crucial role in managing which files and directories are ignored by Git version control. When you're working on a project that is under Git version control, the .gitignore file tells Git which files or folders to exclude from tracking. This is useful for keeping your repository clean and avoiding the inclusion of unnecessary files.

## Requirements - 

### The requirements.txt file is a crucial component in Python projects, especially when it comes to managing dependencies. It lists all the external Python packages (libraries) that your project depends on. This file allows you to easily install the exact versions of the libraries required to run your project in any environment, ensuring consistency and avoiding compatibility issues.
